## About

This project was developed as a collaboration between me and my co-partners, Gurpreet Singh and Rajvansh Singh. 
It uses the PyQt5 library for creating the graphical interface and the playsound library to play the piano notes.
Feel free to explore the code to learn more about how the interface is designed and how notes are played using the playsound library.


## Features

- The piano interface displays a range of keys corresponding to musical notes.
- Clicking on the keys produces the sound of the corresponding note.
- You can also use keyboard shortcuts to play the notes.
